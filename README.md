# generator-politico-interactives [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to scaffold a development environment for building Politico interactives.

### What it does:

- Scaffolds your project's development directory, either for an embeddable feature or a complete interactive page.
- Compiles SCSS and bundles JS written in either ES5 or ES2015 using your choice of browserify or webpack.
- Creates responsive image sets optimized for mobile devices.
- Publishes your project to an Amazon S3 bucket.

### What you'll need installed

Make sure you have [node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) installed as well as the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) package manager.

Then install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and this generator, globally*:
```
$ npm install -g gulp-cli yo generator-politico-interactives
```
_\* You may need to prefix with `sudo`_


### How to use

Create a fresh directory for your project and move into it in your console.

```bash
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
```

Now run the generator and answer the questions it asks to build your dev environment.

```bash
$ yo politico-interactives
```

Run gulp to start the development server.

```bash
$ gulp
```

Develop files in the `src` directory and they will be automatically compiled to the `dist` directory, which are the files that will actually be published.

When you're ready to publish, run the publish command through gulp.

```bash
$ gulp publish
```

## Developing

To develop, clone this repository and use `npm link` to test changes locally before publishing updates.

#### For designers

To change styles, simply update the scss files in the following directory within this generator

- `generators/styles/templates/src/scss/`

Make sure you've run the generator locally to check that your changes carried through.

Once you're satisfied with your changes, publish via the following:
- increment the version number in `package.json`
- commit the repo to github
- run `npm publish`

To change an HTML template, check with a developer.

#### For developers

See [development docs](DEVELOPING.md).
